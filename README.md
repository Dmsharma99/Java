>> Relationship diagram of the Class Relationship between the parent class and the child class
-------------Here the parent class is Vehicles.java and the child class is Bike.java


>> Created a more java class such as child class
--Bike.Java
--Car.Java
--Truck.Java
>> And the parent class is Vehicle.Java
>> Because Some components are same on this Which will be used in every class so for that creating a parent/base class is the process of inheritence in java
