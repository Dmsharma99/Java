// Adding Functionality in Java Classes

// Why we use Obejct Oriented Programming?
// Object-oriented programming allows developers to model real-life scenarios.
// In our example, we use a car model with properties such as doors, engine, driver, and speed. 
// Each property is encapsulated within the class,
// and methods (getters and setters) control access.
